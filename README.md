## Overview

Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has been rebuilt using Flutter. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food to grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.

The objective is to collect as much food as possible without crashing. The game starts off easy, but as the snake grows, it becomes increasingly challenging.
